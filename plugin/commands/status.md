# Show Memory Status

Read these files and summarize the current state:

1. Read `memory/latest.md` — show what was last completed and what's next
2. Read the `## NOW` section of `MEMORY.md` — show the current task pointer

Then suggest what to do next based on the information. Be direct — don't ask the user what they want to do, tell them what the next logical step is based on the memory.

If no memory files exist, say "No session memory found. Start working and use /memex:save when done."
